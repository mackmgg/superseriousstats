/**
 * Parse instructions for the LimeChat logfile format.
 *
 * +------------+-------------------------------------------------------+->
 * | Line	| Format						| Notes
 * +------------+-------------------------------------------------------+->
 * | Normal	| NICK: MSG						| Skip empty lines.
 * | Nickchange	| NICK is now known as NICK				|
 * | Join	| NICK has joined (HOST)				|
 * | Part	| NICK has left (MSG)					| Part message may be empty due to normalization.
 * | Quit	| NICK has left IRC (MSG)				| Quit message may be empty due to normalization. IRC is literal.
 * | Mode	| NICK has changed mode: +o-v NICK NICK			| Only check for combinations of ops (+o) and voices (+v).
 * | Topic	| NICK has set topic: MSG				| Skip empty topics.
 * | Kick	| NICK has kicked NICK (MSG)				| Kick message may be empty due to normalization.
 * +------------+-------------------------------------------------------+->
 *
 * Notes:
 * - normalize_line() scrubs all lines before passing them on to parse_line().
 * - LimeChat uses the same syntax for actions as "normal" lines. This makes the two indistinguishable. Pretty dumb.
 * - Given that nicks can't contain ":" the order of the regular expressions below is irrelevant (current order aims for best performance).
